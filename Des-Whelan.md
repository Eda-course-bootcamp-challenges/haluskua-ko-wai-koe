Where I grew up:
I grew up in Wexford town, County Wexford, Ireland. (Loch Garman in irish)
It's a medium-sized town in the south-east of the country with amazing beaches and down to earth people.
I moved around a lot as a kid, but lived in the Mulgannon for longer than any other area.
It's a little bit posh. or not posh at all, depending on who you speak to.

Where my family is from:
My family are all from Wexford.
My dad grew up in Bernadette Place and my mam grew up near St. Aidan's crescent, both old-school working class areas of the town.
I don't know much about my family beyond a couple of generations back. My dad's family were country people and my mam's were townies.
I'm going to complete a family tree sometime.


My name:
My name is Des(mond) Whelan, or Deasuin O'Faolain in Irish.
