Kia ora koutou katoa.

I moved around New Zealand a lot growing up so it is hard for me to place an area that I feel is home. I feel more like a nomad. However, I have probably spent more time in Te Ika-a-MƒÅui (Wellington) than anywhere else.

My family are from Poland, England, Scotland, Ireland, maybe Bangladesh or South India but not 100% sure on that part, and Spain. Allegedly. 

My name is Matt Bialostocki.
